## General info

Check how it works []()

This is app that I created for my own purposes. I was bored counting my working hours by my self, so I've decided to create app to set date and amount of hours that I worked on single project. 

To create this app I have used few function components. I have also used react calendar, countup and datepicker.
This app is connected with firebase. It Gets, Posts and Updates data from server. Due to api key danger this demo doesn't includes the config component, and code that is menaging data from server is commented. For demo purposes this app is only menaging functions state.
Real app has been published on another site with a secured api key on the backend server side.

It's mobile first app so although it is well styled for desktop I focused on mobile appearance.
